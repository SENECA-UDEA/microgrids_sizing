MicrogridSizing
========

This package uses optimization and simulation models to size the isolated microgrid. Multiple generation units of different technologies (Solar, Wind, Diesel, Batteries.) are considered. The amount of energy generated by each unit in a defined time horizon is calculated. Demand forecasts and environmental variables are used to optimize the sizing microgrid at the lowest possible cost and guaranteeing the reliability.

The package can solve deterministic, stochastic, multiyear deterministic and stochastic multiyear model. The Stochastic Model considers uncertainty in some inputs variables.

The deterministic model is solved with three algorithms: One-Stage Optimization, Two-Stage Optimization with Iterated Local Search (ILS) and Two-Stage Simulation that combines ILS and dispatch strategies. The other three models are solved with the two-stage simulation model.The optimization model is for small data, to solve larger instances there is the two-stage model with optimization or simulation.


Setup
******
The package is compatible with Python version 3 or higher only.
The user is expected to have installed pyomo before running the package.
Go to http://www.pyomo.org for more information.

1. Switch to a proper directory and then type:

::

    git clone https://github.com/SENECA-UDEA/microgrids_sizing.git

2. Go into the microgrids_management folder

::

    cd microgrids_sizing

3. Install the package with the setup.py file:

::

    python setup.py develop

4. For a quick-first run  a) Return to the current path:

::

    cd..

5. For a quick-first run b) run the model:


::

    python -m sizingmicrogrids -df "microgrids_sizing/data/Providencia/demand_Providencia.csv" -sw "microgrids_sizing/data/Providencia/forecast_Providencia.csv"  -id "microgrids_sizing/data/Providencia/instance_data_Providencia.json" -tm "st"

* For the optimization model You need to install a linear solver such as "Gurobi": www.gurobi.com/ (e.g Gurobi, Cplex, SCJP, etc.)

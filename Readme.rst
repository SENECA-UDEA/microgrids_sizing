MicrogridManagement
========

This package uses optimization models to sizing the isolated microgrid.
Multiple generation units of different technologies (Solar, Wind, Diesel, Batteries.) are considered. The amount of energy generated by each unit in a defined time horizon is calculated.
Demand forecasts and environmental variables are used to optimize the sizing microgrid at the lowest possible cost and guaranteeing the reliability.

The optimization model is for small data, to solve larger instances there is the two-stage model with ILS.

To improve the performance of computing time, there is the simulation model with ILS and dispatch strategies, and it can be deterministic or uncertainty.

To improve the quality of solutions, the multi-year model with simulation and ILS can be used instead of one-year as the previous ones.


Setup
******
The package is compatible with Python version 3 or higher only.
The user is expected to have installed pyomo before running the package.
Go to http://www.pyomo.org for more information.

1. Switch to a proper directory and then type:

::

    git clone https://github.com/SENECA-UDEA/microgrids_sizing.git

2. Go into the microgrids_management folder

::

    cd microgrids_sizing

3. Install the package with the setup.py file:

::

    python setup.py develop


4. For a quick-first run :


::

    python -m microgrids_sizing -sw "../data/Providencia/forecast_Providencia.csv"  -df "../data/Providencia/demand_Providencia.csv" -gu "../data/Providencia/parameters_Providencia.csv"

* For the optimization model You need to install a linear solver such as "Gurobi": www.gurobi.com/ (e.g Gurobi, Cplex, SCJP, etc.)

    This function makes a microgrid sizing optimization; 
    according to the two-stage formulation, 
    where iterated local search is done to install the elements, 
    and dispatch strategies to evaluate the performance.
    It starts by importing several data, as well as several functions 
    Then it defines several lists of strategies for the optimization process.
    likewise, calculate the CRF to annualize the costs
    The script then goes on to perform microgrid optimization using the imported 
    functions and the data read in earlier. 
    It solves the model with the ILS and the dispatch strategy, with an aggregation 
    and disaggregation strategy and verifying feasibility.
    Finally, it uses the plotly library to create visualizations of the results of
    the best solution
    The code allows to change to different locations by uncommenting 
    the appropriate lines.
    It also has other tools such as generating Excel files.

    This function uses several procedures to perform
    microgrid sizing optimization; according to the two-stage formulation, 
    where iterated local search is done to install the elements, 
    and dispatch strategies to evaluate the performance and add stochasticity 
    to go from a deterministic model to one with uncertainty
    It starts by importing several modules, as well as several functions 
    It specifies some parameters such as the seed for random and the location 
    Then it defines several lists of strategies for the optimization process.
    likewise, calculate the CRF to annualize the costs
    The script then goes on to perform microgrid optimization using the imported 
    functions and the data read in earlier. 
    Solve the model for each scenario and then determine the best solution, 
    testing all the solutions in the scenarios to determine which is the most 
    robust and most economical.
     
    To solve, It uses the ILS and the dispatch strategy, with an aggregation 
    and disaggregation strategy and verifying feasibility.
    Finally, it uses the plotly library to create visualizations of the results of
    the best solution
    the code creates different scenarios from the probability distribution
    associated with each hourly interval of the data.
    To make the projection of demand, a distinction is made 
    between weekends and weekdays.
    The code allows to change to different locations by uncommenting 
    the appropriate lines.
    It also has other tools such as generating Excel files

    This function uses several data and functions to perform
    microgrid sizing optimization; according to the two-stage formulation, 
    where iterated local search is done to install the elements, 
    and dispatch strategies to evaluate the performance, 
    in addition, the multi-year functionality is added
    It starts by importing several modules, as well as several functions 
    It specifies some parameters such as the seed for random and the location 
    Then it defines several lists of strategies for the optimization process.
    The script then goes on to perform microgrid optimization using the imported 
    functions and the data read in earlier. 
    Solve the model for each scenario and then determine the best solution, 
    testing all the solutions in the scenarios to determine which is the most 
    robust and most economical
     
    to solve, It uses the ILS and the dispatch strategy, with an aggregation 
    and disaggregation strategy and verifying feasibility.
    Finally, it uses the plotly library to create visualizations of the results of
    the best solution
    the code creates different scenarios from the probability distribution
    associated with each hourly interval of the data.
    To make the projection of demand, a distinction is made 
    between weekends and weekdays.
    The code allows to change to different locations by uncommenting 
    the appropriate lines.
    It also has other tools such as generating Excel files.

    '''
    This function uses several data and procedures 
    that are used to create and optimize a microgrid sizing system; for the
    one-stage approach, total optimization.
    The code reads in demand, forecast, and generators and batteries data,
    as well as instance and fiscal data, and uses them to calculate costs, 
    create objects, and define generation rules. 
     
    It then uses this data to create technologies and renewables sets, 
    and calculates the interest rate and fiscal incentives.
    Finally, it creates an optimization model using a solver (Gurobi), 
    and sets the MIP gap.
    The code also uses plotly to create offline plots with the optimization results 
    The code allows to change to different locations by uncommenting 
    the appropriate lines.
    It also has other tools such as generating Excel files.
